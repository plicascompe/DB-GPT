## What is a confirmation ID?
 
A confirmation ID is a unique code that is generated by Microsoft when you activate Office by phone. It is a proof that your installation ID, which is based on your product key and hardware configuration, has been verified and authorized by Microsoft. You need to enter the confirmation ID in the Activation Wizard to complete the activation process.

If you have an internet connection, you can activate Office 2010 online by following these steps:

You will not need a confirmation ID if you activate Office 2010 online.
