# BlackBox Simulation: A Review of the Airbus A330 Prologue
 
The Airbus A330 is one of the most popular long-haul aircraft in the world, with a fly-by-wire system that offers a smooth and comfortable flight experience. But how does it perform in the virtual skies of flight simulation? In this article, we will take a look at the Airbus A330 Prologue package from BlackBox Simulation, a developer that promises to deliver high-quality and realistic Airbus models for FSX and Prepar3D.

The Airbus A330 Prologue package includes four variants of the A330: the A330-200, the A330-300, the A330-200F (cargo version), and the A330-MRTT (multi-role tanker transport) from Airbus Military division. Each variant comes with different engine options: the GE CF6, the Rolls Royce Trent 700, and the Pratt and Whitney 4168. The external models are highly detailed, with over 150 thousand polygons, high-definition textures and bump mapping, and custom animations for the fan blades, wheels, flaps, spoilers, and more.
 
The cockpit of the A330 Prologue is also impressive, with fully functional MFD screens and ECAM displays that show various system status and warnings. The MCDU allows you to program a complete flight plan, with SIDs, STARs, speed and altitude constraints, holding patterns, airways, and alternate airports. You can also see your performance figures, such as V-speeds and fuel predictions. The Prologue version is still a work in progress, so some systems and functionality may be limited or not available yet. However, BlackBox Simulation assures that they will continue to update and improve their product until they reach the full Airbus A330 X-Treme version.
 
The Airbus A330 Prologue package is available for instant download at â¬29.99 from BlackBox Simulation's website[^1^]. You can also try their free demo before buying. The package is compatible with FSX, FSX Steam Edition, Prepar3D v2, v3, and v4. If you are looking for a realistic and immersive Airbus simulation, you may want to give this product a try.

But how does the Airbus A330 Prologue compare to other Airbus add-ons in the market? According to some reviews from flight simulation enthusiasts, the BlackBox Simulation product has some advantages and disadvantages. Some of the positive aspects are:
 
- The external models are very detailed and realistic, with accurate liveries and animations.
- The cockpit is well-designed and functional, with clear and bright displays and switches.
- The flight dynamics are smooth and responsive, with realistic performance and handling.
- The sound effects are immersive and varied, with different engine noises and cockpit alerts.

Some of the negative aspects are:

- The product is still in development, so some features are missing or incomplete, such as the weather radar, the TCAS system, the autothrottle logic, and some MCDU functions.
- The product is not compatible with some third-party add-ons, such as Active Sky, GSX, or FSPassengers.
- The product has some bugs and glitches, such as incorrect fuel consumption, incorrect flap settings, incorrect VNAV calculations, and occasional crashes.
- The product is relatively expensive compared to other Airbus add-ons, especially considering that it is not a finished product yet.

Overall, the Airbus A330 Prologue from BlackBox Simulation is a promising product that offers a realistic and enjoyable Airbus simulation experience. However, it is not without flaws and limitations, and it may not suit everyone's preferences or expectations. If you are interested in this product, you may want to wait for further updates and improvements before buying it. Alternatively, you may want to check out other Airbus add-ons from different developers, such as Aerosoft or FSLabs.
